Bitcoin is [designed](Cryptodynamic-Principles) to operate without permission from any authority. Its [value proposition](Value-Proposition) is entirely based on this property. 

A [market](Glossary#market) can be divided into permissioned and permissionless from the perspective of the [state](Glossary#state). For ease of reference the former is often referred to as "white market" and the latter "black market". White market [trade](Glossary#trade), by definition, requires permission, and black market does not.

As a simple matter of definition, **Bitcoin operations cannot be both white market and permissionless.** Any [person](Glossary#person) operating in the white market requires permission to do so. Bitcoin is therefore inherently a black market money. Its security architecture necessarily assumes it is operating without [state permission](Other-Means-Principle).

The security of Bitcoin does not extend to white market systems. Any system dependent upon the value proposition of Bitcoin must also be black market.
