There is a theory that the [value](Glossary#value) of energy expended by [proof of work](Glossary#proof-of-work) is converted to [coin](Glossary#coin) [value](Glossary#value), in effect "storing" the value for later consumption. To the extent that energy has value, the work is sold for bitcoin, and money is a [store of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value), this is correct.

Yet this is at best a poor metaphor. Miners trade energy for [units](Glossary#unit). However *all* [merchants](Glossary#merchant) who accept units of the coin trade something for it, and all *things* offered in trade represent demand. The theory errs in the implication that energy value expended in [mining](Glossary#mine) is unique in its contribution to value. **Apart from magnitude, one source of demand cannot be a generally greater determinant of value than another.** As such the theory is invalid.

Furthermore, it is a similar error to assert that [money](Money-Taxonomy) is a [store of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value). Money is a store of money. Only objects can actually be stored. The value of money derives entirely from the value of what it can be traded for, to the people trading. As [value is subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value), it is human preference, subject to constant and unpredictable change, and cannot be stored.
