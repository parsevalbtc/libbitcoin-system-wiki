There is a theory that [miners](Glossary#miner) gain financial advantage over other miners by [mining](Glossary#mine) their own [transactions](Glossary#transaction) and "recovering" their own [fees](Glossary#fee).

The theory ignores the [opportunity cost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of mining [block](Glossary#block) space without collecting payment for it. Payment of a fee *of any amount* to one's self is a financial non-event. Failure to collect a fee is a real cost in the amount forgone, as the cost of mining that portion of the block is uncompensated. **The actual fee paid by the miner is the opportunity forgone.** 

There is a related theory that fee estimation tools may be fooled into recommending higher fees than are required. As shown in [Side Fee Fallacy](Side-Fee-Fallacy) this implies a relationship between historical and future fee rates that does not exist, and that all fees are visible on [chain](Glossary#chain), which is not the case.
