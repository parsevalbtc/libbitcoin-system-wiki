Bitcoin [weakness](Axiom-of-Resistance) results from [centralization](Glossary#centralization) and from [pooling](Glossary#pooling). Forces that produce aggregated [mining](Glossary#mine) are called [pooling pressures](Pooling-Pressure-Risk). While pooling weakens [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) security, centralization weakens the security of [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules). Weakness is the result of fewer [people](Glossary#person) with whom to [share risk](Risk-Sharing-Principle).

Consensus risk is shared among active [merchants](Glossary#merchant) only, as they are the people who have the ability to refuse [trade](Glossary#trade) of property for [units](Glossary#unit) that fail to conform to their rules. Financial forces that reduce the number of merchants are called centralization pressures. The problem of [delegation](Glossary#delegation) is that it is commonly coupled with centralization, as is typical in [web wallets](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/web). The wallet not only [owns](Glossary#owner) the saved units but typically also controls [validation](Glossary#validation) of units received in trade. **The latter reduces power over consensus rules to one person for all of the wallets of the service.**

Centralization pressures include:

* Difficulty of use discount.
* On-chain settlement discount.

If [exchange](Glossary#exchange) is difficult for a customer, the merchant must discount merchandise in order to accept the [coin](Glossary#coin). If exchange is difficult for the merchant, an additional cost is incurred. When referring payments to a trusted third party reduces the size of this discount and/or cost, return on capital is increased.

[Transfer](Glossary#transfer) incurs [fees](Glossary#fee) which also requires a merchant to discount merchandise. When using a trusted intermediary to settle transfers off-[chain](Glossary#chain) reduces fees and thereby the discount, return on capital is increased.

Centralization manifests as:

* Payment processors
* Web and other trusting wallets
* Hosted APIs for accessing chain

In a [low threat](Threat-Level-Paradox) environment the merchant has diminished financial incentive to subsidize Bitcoin security. As the [cost of alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls) increases the discount becomes unavoidable. At this point the customer decides the pay a higher price or the merchant closes the business as capital seeks [market](Glossary#market) rates of return.
