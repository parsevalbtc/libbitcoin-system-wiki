Free [market](Glossary#market) [price inflation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) is entirely the consequence of personal preferences, and therefore not derivable from anything else.

* Goods [prices](Glossary#price) are determined subjectively. ([Subjective Theory of Value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value))
* Time preference determines [expansion](Credit-Expansion-Fallacy) of credit on money. ([Time Preference Axiom](Time-Preference-Fallacy))
* Creating [money](Money-Taxonomy) is not price inflationary. ([Inflation Principle](Inflation-Principle))

This could be more simply obtained from the definition of free [market](Glossary#market), as entirely the consequence of personal preferences.
