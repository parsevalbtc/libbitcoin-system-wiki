In attempting to apply the [Regression Theorem](Regression-Fallacy) to Bitcoin one may postulate that Bitcoin began as a "collectible", arising from interest by monetary theorists. The collectible obtained original [use value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value) due to their personal preferences. It was then [bartered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) as a consequence of this [value](Glossary#value), transitioning to a [medium of exchange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange) based on the memory of barter value.

This appears consistent with the [theorem](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/778), which argues that all [money](Money-Taxonomy) *must* originate from a [commodity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity) that obtains barter and then monetary [exchange](Glossary#exchange) value. Yet if commodity value can arise from potential as money then the theorem is [tautological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)), implying nothing more than money is money.

The postulate takes advantage of colloquial ambiguity in the word "commodity", despite the explicit reference to "industrial" use value in the theorem itself. **If anything can be a commodity then the Regression Theorem would imply, contrary to its assertion, that anything can be money.**

The Regression Theorem uses "commodity" to distinguish money from something with no original use value. If it intends that *anything* is a commodity, it is tautological, and otherwise the postulate is a misrepresentation of the theorem.
