[Pooling](Glossary#pooling) pressure is the set of financial incentives for [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) aggregation, specifically:

* [Proximity Premium](Proximity-Premium-Flaw)
* [Variance Discount](Variance-Discount-Flaw)
* [Market Variation](Glossary#variation)
* [Market Distortion](Glossary#distortion)
* [Economies of Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale)

[Latency](Glossary#latency) and [variance](Glossary#variance) are unavoidable. The [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) actually create the first two financial incentives. Variation is a consequence of varying [market](Glossary#market) price for [mining](Glossary#mine) resources. Distortion is a consequence of varying non-market costs including tax, regulation, subsidy, and patent; the force that Bitcoin is intended to [resist](Axiom-of-Resistance). In a high threat environment economies of scale may become negative due to the cost associated with greater [visibility](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/big-in-venezuela/534177/) but may otherwise be positive.

There are several manifestations of pooling. One is geographic, where independent [miners](Glossary#miner) become physically closer together. Another is cooperative, where formerly-independent miners join forces and co-locate [grinding](Glossary#grind). Another is virtual, where miners become [grinders](Glossary#grinder) and aggregate hash rate to a single remote miner. Another is the existence of [relays](Glossary#relay), which [aggregate](Glossary#aggregation) miner [hash power](Glossary#hash-power). Another is capital flow, since the higher hash rate associated with greater capital utilization is a form of co-location. 

**Given a perpetual positive pressure, transaction selection will eventually be reduced to one person's control.** It is possible that this is already the case. The risk to Bitcoin is that one person is the [sole defense](Risk-Sharing-Principle) of [utility](Glossary#utility), making successful [co-option](Glossary#co-option) inevitable. This risk cannot be [mitigated](Balance-of-Power-Fallacy) by the [economy](Glossary#economy).

Pooling pressure is a Bitcoin analogy to the [United States Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov) system. The system was [designed](State-Banking-Principle) to facilitate tax through [debasement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debasement) of a market money. It offered state [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender) for a monetary [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Note) in [trade](Glossary#trade) for [market money](Money-Taxonomy). This combination was designed to create a pressure to collect market money at the central authority. Once this collection was sufficient the state did away with the pretense and simply [seized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) all remaining market money. All states have similar systems and [cooperate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund) to defend them.

This does not imply that mining is adversarial to Bitcoin. Following the analogy, [free banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking) is not adversarial to gold. Mining is a necessary part of Bitcoin. Pooling represents risk, though pooling pressure is not created by miners but by flaws in Bitcoin itself.
