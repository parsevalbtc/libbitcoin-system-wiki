Production and consumption are the complementary [human actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_axiom) of producing and consuming [economic goods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services). The human roles of producer and consumer [should not be conflated](Depreciation-Principle) with the acts of production and consumption. A role refers to intent not action. All producers consume and all consumers produce. Consumption that produces an economic good is production, otherwise it is the process of either [leisure](Labor-and-Leisure) or [waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste).

The [Pure Bank](Pure-Bank) provides the model of all production. A pure producer has [borrowed](Glossary#borrow) capital, consuming it in the creation of a product. The consumed fraction at any time has been [lent](Glossary#lend) to production. The unconsumed fraction at any time has been [reserved](Reserve-Definition) for liquidity. The new product is sold, obtaining [interest](Glossary#interest) on the consumed fraction, returned as [dividend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend). The amount of reserve is the same necessary productive expense as the pure bank's liquidity reserve. **The reserve is only repopulated by more borrowed capital, including dividend/earnings reinvestment.**

A real producer converts time and capital to interest, at the [market](Glossary#market) [price](Glossary#price) of the product produced, just as a real bank obtains interest at the market price. The bank is merely obtaining the interest of another producer by being its investor. This shows the fundamental equivalence of lending as debt and equity, independent of *statutory* distinctions (tax).

A pure consumer hoards capital without any [lent](Glossary#lend) to production. All capital is borrowed and reserved. At 100% reserve there is no interest, no return, and eventually full depreciation. In this case the borrowed capital is considered a gift ([charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(practice))). A real consumer is additionally subject to tax and subsidy, which increases and decreases the rate of hoard depreciation respectively.
