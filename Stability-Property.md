[Value](Glossary#value) is [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) and therefore price constancy is an economic fiction. The [exchange](Glossary#exchange) [prices](Glossary#price) of a money is is determined by its [supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) which is in turn affected by the demand schedules of all people for all products. The stability of a money is not a tendency toward constant price in all other things, it is a [damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio) relationship between demand for the money and its supply.

We can organize monies into three supply categories:

* Market supply ([commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity))
* Monopoly supply ([monopoly](Money-Taxonomy))
* Fixed supply ([bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin))

In any money, destruction of [units](Glossary#unit) decreases supply and therefore increases the value of those that remain. Given that there is no financial incentive for loss it does not impact stability.

Commodity money supply increases due to the financial incentive to [produce more](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining) when price is expected to be at or above production cost (inclusive of capital cost). This relationship between price and supply is predictable despite price (and therefore supply) not being so. Therefore all holders of the money suffer a reduction in value from the increased supply. Competition ensures that this production, financed by existing [owners](Glossary#owner), is limited by current price. The feedback of value decrease resulting from supply increase reduces production incentive, creating stability.

Monopoly money supply is increased arbitrarily (or taxed as [demurrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency))) by the [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) due to the financial reward of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage).

When this monetary inflation is predictable it can be capitalized, which discounts the return on seigniorage. As such changes to supply are often [not published](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/crisis-hit-venezuela-halts-publication-of-another-major-indicator-idUSKBN16S1YF). Due to [state monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly) protection (i.e. production is the crime of counterfeit), competition cannot effectively limit returns. The resulting sovereign [profit](Glossary#profit) (tax) is the reward of seigniorage and the [reason for monopoly money](Reservation-Principle). Monopoly protection is the sole economic distinction between commodity and monopoly money. The supply increase caused by seigniorage is mitigated only by political unrest as [people](Glossary#person) resist the consequential value decrease. This unrest initially manifests as [capital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight), which is countered by [foreign exchange controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls).

As [fees](Glossary#fee) necessarily rise with demand the [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property) eliminates demand for [transaction](Glossary#transaction) of value below the threshold. More generally, the fee level rises to the point where monetary [substitutes](Substitution-Principle) are more cost-effective for a given value transaction. **Stability therefore results from limiting demand directly, in contrast to relying on an increase in supply to do so.** Stability implies that price is bounded, yet it can rise with increased effective [transaction carrying capacity](Scalability-Principle) of the [coin](Glossary#coin), and with increased [utility](Glossary#utility) relative to substitutes.
