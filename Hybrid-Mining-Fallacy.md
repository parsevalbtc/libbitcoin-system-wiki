There is a theory that a combination of [proof-of-work](Glossary#proof) (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) [mining](Glossary#mine) offers a higher level of system security than PoW. The theory implies that a majority of [coin](Glossary#coin) [owners](Glossary#owner) can mitigate "misbehavior" by PoW miners.

In the absence of a [majority hash power](Glossary#majority-hash-power) [miner](Glossary#miner), there is nothing to mitigate. Therefore the theory is premised on increasing the cost of a [censorship](Glossary#censorship) regime. This rests on the unsupportable assumption that PoW miners are not also PoS miners.

The cost of hybrid mining is the combined costs of [work](Glossary#work) and staking, inclusive of capital cost. The return on mining [investment](Glossary#lend) necessarily equates to capital cost, as a consequence of competition. As mining is profitable, capital cost does not contribute to security. **Achieving majority stake is no more costly than achieving majority hash power.** The theory is therefore invalid.

Given a model whereby a majority stakeholder can prevent confirmation of otherwise [valid](Glossary#validity) PoW blocks, once a majority is achieved the censor [cannot be unseated](Proof-of-Stake-Fallacy). Such a system is fundamentally a PoS coin, lacking [censorship resistance](Censorship-Resistance-Property), with the PoW aspect providing no additional security.
