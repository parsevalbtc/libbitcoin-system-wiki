There is a theory that, to the extent Bitcoin [mining](Glossary#mine) can consume a necessary and otherwise unmarketable [byproduct](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste) of energy production, such as [unused natural gas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_flare), a reduction in net energy consumption is implied.

Given a new byproduct [market](Glossary#market), not taking advantage of the presumed lower [price](Glossary#price) represents [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) to each [miner](Glossary#miner). Competition for the byproduct increases its price, eventually up to the level where the net advantage is eliminated. In the interim this represents a mining profit [opportunity](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-waste-oil-industry).

 [Paradoxically](Efficiency-Paradox), any reduced cost results in proportionally greater consumption. The reduced cost of mining must result in increased mining so that its cost returns to the [reward](Glossary#reward) level. So the byproduct formerly "consumed" as waste increases mining hash rate until the same cost is consumed in mining. Net mining energy consumption is actually increased by the lower [price](Glossary#pricer).

Yet in monetizing a waste resource, the overall marketable energy supply is increased without an increase in its production cost. And demand for the otherwise marketable energy supply in mining is decreased. This implies a reduced market energy price.

A corresponding expansion of production generally may result from a reduced market
energy price. This [price stability](Stability-Property) is a general characteristic of all products. **As such a consequent reduction in overall energy consumption from byproduct mining cannot be assumed,** invalidating the theory. However, an overall increase in wealth is implied by greater production at the same cost or same production at lower cost.
