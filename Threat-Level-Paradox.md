As implied by the [zero sum property](Zero-Sum-Property), presumably the only way to defeat external [subsidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy) is to [mine](Glossary#mine) at a capital loss relative to [market](Glossary#market) return on capital. Similarly it seems that only way to defeat tax, up to and including a 100% tax (prohibition), is to mine beyond the reach of the taxing authority, such as in secret. As with all [black markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market) there is an increased cost to [subversive mining](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/big-in-venezuela/534177). Competing against subsidized mining compounds the cost.

If one accepts the [axiom of resistance](Axiom-of-Resistance) one must assume that both tax and subsidy will be used to reduce the cost of [controlling](Glossary#power) Bitcoin. Using the power to subsidize mining (via tax revenues), [states](Glossary#state) can cause [pooling](Glossary#pooling) in the region of the subsidy. Once [majority hash power](Glossary#majority-hash-power) is focused the state can use its taxing (regulatory) power in the region to compel [censorship](Glossary#censorship).

Therefore in order to enjoy the benefits of a hard currency, it would seem that [people](Glossary#person) will ultimately have to mine at a loss. However, censorship creates the opportunity for others to mine profitably to the extent that people are willing to offset this cost with [fees](Glossary#fee). This black [market](Glossary#market) is Bitcoin's censorship resistance. People pay a higher price for certain transactions, and in order to maintain that higher price the state must also suffer the expense, despite its ineffectiveness.

**Paradoxically, this tool works well when money is under attack and poorly otherwise.** If there was no *internal* [pooling-pressure](Pooling-Pressure-Risk) these cases would be balanced. But [risk distribution](Risk-Sharing-Principle) is essential to subversive mining, and pooling pressure works *against* distribution. So there is ever-expanding [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface) with no pressure to contract unless effective monetary alternatives are suppressed. The [suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls) of alternatives raises [reward](Glossary#reward) [utility](Glossary#utility) to the miner in the region of suppression. The paradox applies as well to [centralization pressures](Centralization-Risk).

The expected consequence is that Bitcoin will not be well *prepared* for [attacks](Glossary#attack) because it is financially disadvantageous for [people](Glossary#person) in a low threat environment.
