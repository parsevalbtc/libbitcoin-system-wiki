In modern logic an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) is a premise, it cannot be proven. It is a starting assumption against which other things may be proven. For example, in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) one cannot prove that parallel lines never meet. It simply defines the particular geometry.

Proving statements about Bitcoin requires reliance on axiomatic systems, specifically [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory), [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms) and [catallactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics), and therefore the assumptions upon which they rely. However Bitcoin also relies on an axiom not found in these systems. Satoshi alludes to this in an early [statement](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/4):

In other words there is an assumption that it is *possible* for a system to resist [state](Glossary#state) control. This is not accepted as a fact but deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to the behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.

**One who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an entirely different system than Bitcoin.** If one assumes it is *not possible* for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not make sense in the context of Bitcoin - just as conclusions in [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry) contradict Euclidean. How can Bitcoin be [permissionless](Permissionless-Principle) or [censorship-resistant](Censorship-Resistance-Property) without the axiom? The contradiction leads one to make [obvious errors](Hearn-Error) in an attempt to rationalize the conflict.

It is common for people to refer cynically to a Bitcoin-like system that omits the resistance axiom as just another "PayPal", a designation not without merit. [Confinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity) originally attempted to create a system with a similar [value proposition](Value-Proposition) to Bitcoin. Having failed to do so it discarded the axiom, building the [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) we know today.
