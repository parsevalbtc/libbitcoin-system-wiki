**Maximalism is a public relations effort to discourage the formation of substitutes for a given coin.** To the extent this is successful it may benefit existing [owners](Glossary#owner) by restricting supply and subsequently elevating [price](Glossary#price). However as [people](Glossary#person) fail to find close [substitutes](Substitution-Principle), activity moves to more distant ones. In the case of electronic payments this is generally [state](Glossary#state) money.

Maximalism is distinct from [shitcoin](Shitcoin-Definition) awareness in that it is characterized by promotion of one Bitcoin over all others. Proponents often express the contradictory theory that no other coin could be competitive with their preferred coin. If this was the case there would be no reason to advocate for a single coin.
