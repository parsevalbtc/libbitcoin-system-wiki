Bitcoin is a set of [essential concepts](Cryptodynamic-Principles), not a [chain](Glossary#chain). No [person](Glossary#person) can control the concepts. People will use it to describe one or more chains and [splits](Glossary#split) as they evolve. This happens with all [monies](Money-Taxonomy), including gold and oil which trade at different purities and qualities.

This is consistent with the declaration of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), as it binds a set of concepts, not a set of [rules](Glossary#rule), [protocols](Glossary#protocol), or [implementations](Glossary#implementation). **People with capital invested have an inherent desire for brand association, but there is no such thing as a "legitimate" claim to it.**
