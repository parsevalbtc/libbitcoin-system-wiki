There is a theory that selling [units](Glossary#unit) from one side of a [split](Glossary#split) [coin](Glossary#coin) for units of the other reduces the relative [utility](Glossary#utility) of the sold coin. However each sale requires a buyer. As a [trade](Glossary#trade) the action is symmetrical and therefore the theory is invalid. 

There is a related theory that [exchanging](Glossary#exchange) units from one side of a split coin constitutes [dumping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)) of that coin, which reduces its utility. **The theory simply misrepresents the concept of dumping.** Dumping is [state](Glossary#state) [subsidy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy) (not to be confused with Bitcoin [subsidy](Glossary#subsidy)) of a product sold in another state. It is a levy on the taxpayers of the subsidizing state, typically applied to establish [market](Glossary#market) share for the product. In the case where demand is [elastic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand), the subsidy increases sales volume for the product by reducing [price](Glossary#price) relative to the otherwise market price. The lower price increases demand, by capturing buyers with lower [marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) for the product, until the market clears. In contrast to dumping, trading at market price doesn't reduce price because it is not subsidized.

Finally, there is a related theory that reduction of [hoarding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics)) generally reduces exchange prices of the hoarded property. This is [true](https://mises.org/blog/problem-hoarding), however a [transfer](Glossary#transfer) is not a reduction to hoarding levels unless the buyer of the hoarded property subsequently hoards it less than the seller. It is an error to assume this is the case.
