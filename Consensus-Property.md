[People](Glossary#person) generally think of [consensus](Glossary#consensus) in the context of a fixed membership, like a [jury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury). In this model consensus implies that all members must agree. **But because Bitcoin membership is permissionless and therefore not fixed, there is always complete agreement, as implied by membership**. In this model consensus refers to the size of the membership ([economy](Glossary#economy)), not a condition of agreement.

A consensus may [fragment](Fragmentation-Principle) or [consolidate](Consolidation-Principle). Generally a larger consensus provides greater [utility](Glossary#utility) and greater security by more broadly [sharing risk](Risk-Sharing-Principle).
