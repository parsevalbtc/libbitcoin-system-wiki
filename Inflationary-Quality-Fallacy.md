There is a theory that the [price inflation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) caused by [seigniorage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) causes the production of lower "quality" and/or less [durable](Depreciation-Principle) goods. Durability is one of many qualities that a [person](Glossary#person) might [value](Glossary#value) in one good over another. **The theory necessarily presumes that value is objective and therefore contradicts the subjective theory of value.** As such the theory is invalid.

There is no provable relation between the number of [units](Glossary#unit) of [money](Money-Taxonomy) required to trade for a good and the qualities of a good that one might prefer. Greater wealth (which is perception, as value is [subjective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value)), implies lower [time preference](Time-Preference-Fallacy), as implied by the theory of marginal [utility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility). However even under the assumption of a misperception of increasing wealth, lower time preference does not imply a preference for lower "quality" goods. It implies only an increasing willingness to [lend](Glossary#lend) a greater portion of one's capital.[Rothbard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard) makes this "subtle" error in "[*What Has Government Done to Our Money*](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money/html/p/81)", one that continues to be perpetuated.

It is assumed, certainly by Rothbard, that people *always* prefer to get rich sooner than later, as implied by the axiom of time preference. And as shown by the [Fisher Hypothesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_hypothesis), to the extent that price inflation is predictable it is offset in the [real interest rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate). To the extent it is not predictable Rothbard's conjecture does not apply.

Seigniorage is a tax, which makes people poorer. Being poorer *increases* time preference, the opposite effect described by the theory. All tax shifts property involuntarily from some people to other people, as that is its only actual mechanism and objective respectively. As Rothbard himself elaborates in his more formal "[*Man Economy and State*](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/ppp/1393)", the form of the tax is economically irrelevant.

> For all these reasons, the goal of uniformity of taxation is an impossible one. It is not simply difficult to achieve in practice; it is conceptually impossible and self-contradictory.

> *Murray Rothbard: Man Economy and State*

Therefore it cannot be shown that seigniorage itself makes people poorer than the taxes it presumably replaces. Only a net increase in tax implies a reduction in wealth.
